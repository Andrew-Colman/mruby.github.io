    <h2>About mruby</h2>
    <p>
      mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part of) the 
      ISO standard. mruby can be linked and embedded within your application. We provide the 
      interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples. You can 
      also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby compiler "mrbc". All 
      those tools reside in "bin" directory. The "mrbc" is also able to generate compiled byte 
      code in a C source file. You can check the "mrbtest" program under the "test" directory.
